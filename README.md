# Brute Force Password Cracker
This Python script is a simple brute force password cracker that employs a time-based approach to crack passwords character by character. 
It prompts the user to input a password and then iterates through each character of the password using a brute force method until it successfully matches each character. 
The script measures the time taken to crack the password.


## Features
- Brute force approach to crack passwords character by character.
- Measures the time taken to crack the password.
- Supports a wide range of characters including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.


## How it Works
- The script prompts the user to input a password.
- It iterates through each character of the password using a brute force method.
- For each character, it generates random guesses until it matches the character of the password.
- Once all characters are matched, the password is revealed, and the time taken to crack the password is displayed.
